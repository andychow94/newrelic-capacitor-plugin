## Feature Requests

Feature requests should be submitted in the [Issue tracker](../../issues), with a description of the expected behavior & use case, where they’ll remain closed until sufficient interest, [e.g. :+1: reactions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/), has been [shown by the community](../../issues?q=label%3A%22votes+needed%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
Before submitting an Issue, please search for similar ones in the
[closed issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aenhancement).

## Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Developing

### Local Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo.
1. Install the dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1. Install SwiftLint if you're on macOS.

    ```shell
    brew install swiftlint
    ```

### Scripts

#### `npm run build`

Build the plugin web assets and generate plugin API documentation using [`@capacitor/docgen`](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-docgen).

It will compile the TypeScript code from `src/` into ESM JavaScript in `dist/esm/`. These files are used in apps with bundlers when your plugin is imported.

Then, Rollup will bundle the code into a single file at `dist/plugin.js`. This file is used in apps without bundlers by including it as a script in `index.html`.

#### `npm run verify`

Build and validate the web and native projects.

This is useful to run in CI to verify that the plugin builds for all platforms.

#### `npm run lint` / `npm run fmt`

Check formatting and code quality, autoformat/autofix if possible.

This template is integrated with ESLint, Prettier, and SwiftLint. Using these tools is completely optional, but the [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community/) strives to have consistent code style and structure for easier cooperation.

#### `npm run test:android` / `npm run test:ios`

Runs unit tests against each platform for the Capacitor plugin.

Note that the iOS script requires a destination to run the tests against. You can set the destination by running:
`npm run test:ios -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14 Pro Max,OS=16.0'`.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
You can run unit tests by running the above testing scripts listed above. You can find these tests in:
- Android: `android/src/test/java/com/getcapacitor/NewReplicCapacitorPluginUnitTest.java`
- iOS: `ios/PluginTests/NewRelicCapacitorPluginTests.swift`

### Writing Tests

For most contributions it is strongly recommended to add additional tests which
exercise your changes.

This helps us efficiently incorporate your changes into our mainline codebase
and provides a safeguard that your change won't be broken by future development.

There are some rare cases where code changes do not result in changed
functionality (e.g. a performance optimization) and new tests are not required.
In general, including tests with your pull request dramatically increases the
chances it will be accepted.

## Publishing

There is a `prepublishOnly` hook in `package.json` which prepares the plugin before publishing, so all you need to do is run:

```shell
npm publish
```

> **Note**: The [`files`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#files) array in `package.json` specifies which files get published. If you rename files/directories or add files elsewhere, you may need to update it.
